# Piazza Post for HuskyTeams

**Subject:** 🎯 Introducing HuskyTeams - Find Your Perfect Project Team!

Hey everyone! 👋

So I was in class yesterday and heard Professor [Name] mention that many of you are on Piazza looking for teammates who match/complement your skillsets to form project teams and connect with classmates. That got me thinking...

**What if there was a better way?**

I'm excited to introduce you to **HuskyTeams** 🐾 - a platform designed specifically for our class to find your perfect project team and connect based on detailed profiles!

**What makes HuskyTeams special:**
- 📋 Create your profile with skills, availability, and project interests
- 🔍 Browse and filter classmates by skills, availability, team size preferences, and more
- 💡 See compatibility scores to find the best matches
- 🤝 Send interest requests and build your team (2-4 members)
- ⚡ Quick and easy onboarding - get started in minutes!

**The story behind it:**
I actually built this yesterday in about 2 hours after class, but got caught up in meetings this morning and forgot to share it! 😅 Better late than never, right?

**Try it out here:** [Your Vercel URL - e.g., https://student-networking-app-flame.vercel.app]

It's completely free, built specifically for our CS5130 class, and I'd love to hear your feedback! Feel free to check it out, create your profile, and let me know what you think. If you run into any issues or have suggestions, just drop a comment below.

Looking forward to seeing you all on the platform! 🚀
